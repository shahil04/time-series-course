Perfect! Here's a **step-by-step learning path** to master **Time Series Analysis** from scratch — covering everything you asked: foundations, real-world projects, specific models, and model comparison.

---

## 🎯 STAGE 1: **Foundation & Prerequisites**

### 📘 Week 1–2: Time Series Basics with Python

#### ✅ Topics:

* What is time series data?
* Types: **Univariate** vs **Multivariate**
* Time-based indexing (`DatetimeIndex`)
* Resampling (upsampling/downsampling)
* Handling missing timestamps and gaps

#### ✅ Practice:

* Dataset: [AirPassengers](https://datamarket.com/data/set/22u3/)

---

## 🎯 STAGE 2: **Exploratory Time Series Analysis (ETSA)**

### 📘 Week 3:

#### ✅ Topics:

* Visualizing trend, seasonality, and noise
* ACF & PACF plots
* Stationarity check (ADF, KPSS test)
* Time Series Decomposition (additive/multiplicative)

#### 🧪 Project Dataset:

* **Electricity consumption**, **Retail sales**, or **Weather data**

---

## 🎯 STAGE 3: **Model Building – Classical**

### 📘 Week 4:

#### ✅ Models:

* **AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA**
* **SARIMA / SARIMAX**
* Model diagnostics and tuning (AIC/BIC)
* Forecasting future points

#### 🧪 Project:

* Forecast **Monthly Sales** of a store (Retail dataset)

---

## 🎯 STAGE 4: **Model Building – Modern**

### 📘 Week 5:

#### ✅ Models:

* **Facebook Prophet** (great for business/time-aware forecasting)
* **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)**
* **VAR for Multivariate Series**

#### 🧪 Project:

* Forecast **COVID-19 cases** or **Energy demand**

---

## 🎯 STAGE 5: **Deep Learning for Time Series**

### 📘 Week 6–7:

#### ✅ Models:

* **LSTM**, **GRU**, **Bidirectional LSTM**
* Attention Mechanisms
* Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
* Transformers for time series

#### 🧪 Project:

* Forecast **Stock Prices** using LSTM
* Dataset: Yahoo Finance + `yfinance` API

---

## 🎯 STAGE 6: **Model Comparison + Best Practices**

### 📘 Week 8:

#### ✅ Topics:

* Cross-validation for time series (TimeSeriesSplit, Rolling CV)
* Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAPE, SMAPE, MAE
* Model comparison: ARIMA vs Prophet vs LSTM
* Ensembling predictions

---

## 🎯 STAGE 7: **Production-Ready Real-World Project**

### 🛠️ Full Project:

* **End-to-end forecasting app** (e.g., Sales or Stock Forecasting)
* Tech stack: `Flask` + `LSTM/Prophet` + `Plotly Dash/Streamlit` + `Docker`
* Deployment: **Heroku/GCP/AWS**

---

## ✅ Tools You’ll Use:

* `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `pmdarima`
* `fbprophet`, `darts`, `sktime`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `pytorch`, `scikit-learn`

Would you like me to:

1. Start preparing **Week 1 study notes and exercises**?
2. Share **real datasets** for each phase?
3. Help set up the **final full project environment (Flask + Streamlit + Docker)?**
